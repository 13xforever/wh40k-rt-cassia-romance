Cassia Romance for Female Players
=================================
This is a Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader mod to remove gender checks for Cassia romance dialog branches.
Some choices and replies are locked behind a gender lock for narrative reasons.

Ideally these changes should be done through Owlcat's [simple modding support](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/discussions/18446744073709551615/4027970580221500367/?appid=2186680) with blueprint patches, but unfortunately at this time this is not possible due to blueprint patch system limitations.

Instead, this mod is a [UMM plugin](https://wiki.nexusmods.com/index.php/How_to_create_mod_for_unity_game) that does the same changes to blueprint condition checks in runtime.


How to install
==============
Unpack zip to `%UserProfile%\AppData\LocalLow\Owlcat Games\Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader\UnityModManager` (there should be new folder `RT.UMM.CassiaRomanceF` there with mod files inside).

It should be enabled by default, but you can check the status in UMM (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F10</kbd> in game).
